# CVE-2021-44228_scanner
Applications that are vulnerable to the log4j CVE-2021-44228 issue may be detectable by scanning jar, war, and ear files to search for the presence of `JndiLookup.class`.

Depending on the platform that you are investigating, the PowerShell or the Python3 script may make more sense to run.  In both cases, the optional argument is the top-level directory that you would like to use to begin your search.

Any file discovered is worth investigation to determine if the application using it is vulnerable. For any `JndiLookup.class` that is present, log4j commonly includes the version in the jar file name. For example, a hit on `log4j-core-2.14.1.jar` would be indicative of a vulnerable application. Alternatively, `log4j-core-2.16.jar` may also produce a hit because the JndiLookup code is still present in the 2.16 version of log4j, but it is disabled by default.  See [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) for more details.

For example, here is an invocation of the PowerShell version of the scanner:
![checkjndi.ps1 execution on c:\\](checkjndi_ps1.png "checkjndi.ps1 execution on c:\\")

Similarly, here is an invocation of the Python3 version:
For example, here is an invocation of the PowerShell flavor of the scanner:
![checkjndi.py execution on c:\\](checkjndi_py.png "checkjndi.py execution on c:\\")

Let's look at the first hit:
`C:\tmp\2.16\log4j-core-2.16.0.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

Assuming that the software has not been misleadingly renamed, it's probably safe to say that this hit is a false positive, as version 2.16 of log4j is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228. The reason it is reported by the scanner is that the JndiLookup code **is** still present in this version, but it is disabled by default and also the message lookups feature has been removed.

Let's look at the second hit:
`C:\tmp\ghidra_10.0_PUBLIC\Ghidra\Framework\Generic\lib\log4j-core-2.12.1.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

Here we can see that Ghidra uses log4j version 2.12.1, and as such we should assume it to be vulnerable. And indeed, Ghidra versions before 10.1 are [vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_10.1_build).

You should investigate any hits reported by either of these scripts, and confirm that either the log4j version is indeed the fixed 2.16 version, or reach out to your software vendor to obtain a fixed version of the software. Alternatively, [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) has information about how `JndiLookup.class` can be removed from vulnerable jar files.
